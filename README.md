# Vietnam-Map-Graph-Coloring

This is a project using simple AI algorithms to solve the Graph Coloring with Vietnam Map. 

Vietnam Map includes 63 provinces. Maximum number of colors in this solution is 10. I choose this threshold due to I do not see any faster the solving speed will be if the number applied is more than 10.

This project consists of 2 solutions: Best First Search algorithm and Hill Climbing algorithm.
